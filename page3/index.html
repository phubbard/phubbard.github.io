<p>One of them is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just buy that Lange (or Patek, or Rolex, or Vacheron, or whatever your personal Grand Ultimate Fetish Object is) first, and save yourself some agony and expense. Once you've gotten The Best, you may be able to resist a lot of impulse purchases, and avoid cluttering up your house with watchwinders, cases, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, after much searching, this is <strong>it</strong>, my personal GUFU:</p>

<p>Quick factoids for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It's the new <a href="http://www.watchreport.com/2005/05/the_seiko_sprin.html">Spring Drive 5R66A movement.</a></p>

<h2>Why this one?</h2>
<p>So, you ask, why this one? What makes it the GUFO for me?</p>
<p>Hmm. I like auto divers quite a lot. I <em>love</em> the <a href="http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=tree&amp;goto=1276772&amp;rid=0">SpringDrive</a> movement; it's a really cool advance from mechanical. Ten times as accurate as my current watch. I place a high value on legibility, and this has it in spades, both time and GMT.</p>
<p>I also fly, and for that a GMT hand and legibility are paramount. I have a pilot's watch, but it's so busy-faced as to be unreadable. I much prefer flying with my diver, which I can read instantly and in bad lighting.</p>
<p>I also like the fact that this is a really odd watch, so no one is going to recognize it. This is not something where even the average Seiko fan will recognize it, so it's more internal gratification than external recognition; I like it that way. If you want bling, buy a Rolex.</p>
<p>If I get back into diving (likely), I dunno if I'll have the guts to dive with this; its one more thing to worry about damaging. I'll probably just wear my yellow-face diver instead. It's nice to know that this one would dive as well, well past any depth I'll ever get to.</p>
<h3>The Bad News</h3>
<p>The bad news: List price is 450 <em>thousand</em> yen. Discounted, that's about three grand USD.</p>
<p>Wow. Here I used to disrespect the Rolex fanboys, and I discover this shameful need for a massively over-engineered and overpriced bit of <a href="http://velociphilewatch.blogspot.com/2005/09/seiko-spring-drive-akahanes-pointless.html">newly obsolete technology.</a></p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that <a href="http://debrief.commanderbond.net/index.php?s=084ae10ed70b06bdbf2f49e25547dc23&amp;showtopic=20042&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=413670">no real diver</a> would ever spend this much on a watch when <a href="http://www.phfactor.net/wp/?p=7">dive computers have replaced watches</a> anyway. Then again, it's a magnificent ode to a world passed by, and one hell of a cool watch.</p>
<h2>More information</h2>
<p>I highly recommend that you read these threee reviews. The first has a great deal of history, and an extensive comparison with the Marinemaster that preceded it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.larrybiggs.net/scwf/index.php?mod=103&amp;action=1&amp;id=1118149400">Various and sundry thoughts on the Seiko 600M SpringDrive</a></p>
<p>The second is a bit shorter, and has more details on the movement and specs:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.larrybiggs.net/scwf/index.php?mod=103&amp;action=0&amp;id=1123544561">1 week with the Spring Drive Marine Master</a></p>
<p>The third is TimeZone, and quite good:
<a href="http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=tree&amp;goto=1276772&amp;rid=0">Seiko Spring Drive 600M Diver... Information and mimi review</a></p>
<p>The ever-trusty Watch Report has a nice one-pager:
<a href="http://www.watchreport.com/2005/05/the_seiko_marin.html">The Seiko Marinemaster GMT Spring Drive (Ref SBDB001)</a></p>
<p>Lastly, Timezone has <a href="http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=tree&amp;goto=1276772&amp;rid=0">a great in-depth look at SpringDrive</a> that's quite interesting. The <a href="http://www.watchreport.com/2005/05/the_seiko_sprin.html">Watch Report has a nice writeup</a> on SpringDrive as well.</p>
<h3>Pictures!</h3>
<p>Every good case of gadget infatuation starts with pictures; here's are a couple picture galleries of this watch:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://192.244.1.65/ca07000/cgi-bin/Blah/Blah.cgi?b=77,v=post,m=1115881272,q=0">Higuchi-san</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jgauch/watch/divers/SBDB001.html">Someone random with a nice gallery</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Got cash?</h2>
<p>If you want one and (unlike me) can afford it, there's only a couple of reputable dealers who can import it. (For reasons known only to them, it's not sold outside Japan.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://kseiya.zoovy.com/product/S05051">K Seiya</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.higuchi-inc.com/sbdb001.html">Higuchi Inc.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>It verges on criminally stupid to even consider spending this much on a watch, really. Then again, if we can't save for things that make us happy, what exactly are we living for anyway?</p>
<p>We'll see if my infatuation holds out, but it's lasted two months so far and isn't abating. Not a good sign for my future.</p>

         			<span class="by">Posted on 28 Oct 2005.</span>
        			<p><p>I'm now on my second month of wearing this watch</p>
<p><a href="http://www.princetonwatches.com/shop/SKXA35.asp"><img src="http://www.phfactor.net/pics/watches/SKXA35.JPG"></a></p>
<p>and in the process I've had some (to me) interesting thoughts on why, in this day and age, anyone would wear a mechanical watch.The answers are both complicated and amusing.</p>
<h2>A bit of background on quartz and mechanical timekeeping</h2>
<p>The oldest clocks post-sundial were, of course, mechanical. In the 1970s, the rise of quartz watches ended the reign of gears and pinions. (<a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/quartz-watch.htm">HowStuffWorks has a nice entry on quartz watches.</a>) Briefly, quartz watches are cheaper, more reliable, more robust and more accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Much</strong> more accurate. The most expensive (e.g. Rolex) mechanical watches are often labeled as "Swiss certified chronometers" or similar. This means they've <a href="http://www.timezone.com/library/wbore/wbore631733384647656250">passed a battery of tests at COSC</a>, certifying them to <strong>-4 to +6 seconds per day.</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a cheap quartz is often accurate to <strong>0.5 seconds per day</strong>. Better quartz manages 0.1 seconds/day, and <a href="http://www.higuchi-inc.com/thecitizen.html">really accurate ones</a> manage <strong>3 seconds per year.</strong></p>
<p>A bit of math shows that quartz is up to 400 times as accurate as mechanical. Amazing, isn't it? <a href="http://www.dansdata.com/danletters149.htm">Dan's data</a> puts it very well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of these things are very much obsolete technology these days, after all - remember, a mechanical Jaeger-LeCoultre that appears to have been made by elves and costs as much as a car still won't keep time nearly as well as a $10 quartz watch.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Geeks and watches</h2>
<p><a href="http://catandgirl.com/view.php?loc=94">Nerds (or, more accurately, geeks)</a> such as myself usually choose a watch on functionality and cost. Ask a random geek why they chose their watch, and the answer usually revolves around functionality - features such as timers, physical robustness or price. Pragmatism tends to rule. <a href="http://www.watchreport.com/2005/06/review_of_the_c.html">Casio G-Shock</a> and Timex predominate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/watches/">(There are exceptions</a>, which mainly are about advertising your geekiness and alpha-nerd status.)</p>
<h3>A digression into other fields</h3>
<p>If you're in a job where appearances are more important, watches play a very different role. There, they are part of your ensemble and are used to <a href="http://www.askmen.com/fashion/austin/austin6.html">establish pecking order</a> and such. (Though, ironically, the watches recommended there are disdained by watch geeks.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n10_v46/ai_15454460/print">William Buckley wrote an entertaining article about watches</a>, and ended up with an Omega. He doesn't say <em>which</em> Omega, though. For amusement, I contacted Omega and asked them which model Buckley was referring to. They replied only to tell me that 'this model was no longer in production.' Gee, thanks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.professionalimagedress.com/men_finishing_touches.htm">Job interviews</a> are another place for fancy watches.</p>
<h3>Retrocomputing</h3>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time trying to reconcile my enjoyment of the mechanicals with the rest of my geek lifestyle, and finally found a reasonable explanation:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocomputing">Retrocomputing. (Wikipedia link)</a></p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, nerds of all stripes often venerate obsolete technology. Not just <a href="http://digg.com/links/The_Flying_Toasters_Screensaver_for_free_">old software</a>, it also includes <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/18/howto_make_a_quill_p.html">quill pens</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69254,00.html">bicycles</a>, <a href="http://www.pinhole.org/">cameras</a>, <a href="http://www.trebuchet.com/">trebuchets</a>, <a href="http://www.xat.nl/enigma/">WW2 crypto hardware</a>, <a href="http://www.commemorativeairforce.org/">old warplanes</a>, etc, etc. Mechanical watches fit right in here. Quite a bit more practical than, say, <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/organ/organ.html">a home pipe organ.</a></p>
<p>The other factor is more personal. Perhaps because I grew up with them, I can read an analog watch much faster than digital. (<a href="http://itotd.com/articles/297/">I'm not alone in this. Even Douglas Adams thought so.</a>) I'm also a big fan of <a href="http://www.phfactor.net/wp/?p=32">combined analog/digital</a>, which can give you the best of both worlds.</p>
<h3>Yeah, but why <em>yellow</em>?</h3>
<p>Perhaps because its obnoxious. Perhaps because I found it more readable than <a href="http://www.pmwf.com/Watches/Seiko/SKX779KFront.htm">black</a>, <a href="http://home.woh.rr.com/johnholbrook/seikoskx781k.html">orange</a> or <a href="http://www.pmwf.com/Watches/WATCHSALES03/SEIKOSKXA49K1BlackKnightDiver/SEIKOBlackKnightSKXA49K1.htm">white.</a></p>
<p>OK, I actually found the white after I bought the yellow. In retrospect, maybe I'd get the white. Or not. The yellow color is actually extremely legible in almost all conditions; quite functional.</p>
<h2>What's so cool about mechanical?</h2>
<p>You can find good information in <a href="http://people.timezone.com/mdisher/TZMainFAQ/RevisedFAQ11_7.htm">the mechanical watch FAQ</a>, but the Seiko I have, model SKXA35, has a 7S26 movement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thepurists.com/watch/features/8ohms/7s26/index.html">Read this review</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thepurists.com/watch/features/8ohms/7s26/index.html"><img src="http://fnord.phfactor.net/pics/watches/movement.jpg" alt="7s26 movement"></a></p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.thepurists.com/watch/features/8ohms/7s26/index.html">the complete review of the 7S26</a> and then come back. No really, <strong>go read it</strong>.</p>
<p>There's an <em>awesome</em> amount of coolness there. Mechanical design, while disdained by EE/CS/CE geeks, is every bit as difficult and nifty, and watch movements require a lot of ingenuity. Even a budget movement like the 7S26 is an amazing bit of engineering, art and optimization.</p>
<p>(True, quartz is cool too, but moving electrons are less visible and most chips lack visual appeal. (At least the chip casings. Chips themselves are often beautiful, and many contain <a href="http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/creatures/">hidden artwork</a>.))</p>
<p>Seiko in particular has an excellent reputation in this area, where the 7S26 and relatives are considered 'nearly as good' as the marquee brands, and a great deal cheaper. (If you want to spend the money, Seiko of course makes watches <a href="http://www.larrybiggs.net/scwf/index.php?mod=103&amp;action=1&amp;id=1118149400">as good or better than the Swiss</a>, priced accordingly.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I highly recommend a read-up on mechanicals. I'll have more details on my Seiko, and others, as time permits.</p>
<h2>Other reasons to think about</h2>
<p>As a grown-up male no longer dating, American society is very limiting on personal adornment. I gave up the earrings and such, so if I want to have any sort of style there aren't many choices. You can pick clothing from a different chain, but <em>what</em> you can wear is still pretty circumscribed. Ditto hairstyle. Watches are one area where we can still have <strong>style</strong>. You might also find that the geek coolness of having a self-winding compact machine compelling. As one TimeZone poster put it, mechanical watches <em>depend</em> on the wearer in a way that quartz doesn't. It's like a mini-pet for the pathetic, a Tamagotchi for the techie.</p>
<p>Another reason that sounds silly is the motion of the second hand. Quartz watches move once per second, but mechanicals move 5-8 times per second, in much smaller increments. The resulting smooth sweep is mesmerizing, though perhaps I shouldn't admit to it. (As an aside, it's also a quick way to tell if the Rolex is a bad fake with a quartz movement.)</p>
<h2>Does accuracy matter? How much?</h2>
<p>Many people want an accurate watch, for what use is a timepiece tha's wrong? Part of the reason I started thinking about this at all was my acquisition of what may be <a href="http://www.watchreport.com/2005/05/mini_review_of_.html">the ultimate quartz watch.</a> Perfectly accurate (radio set), solar powered, tough as nails, analog/digital, and <strong>blue LED backlighting</strong> to boot. Geek nirvana.</p>
<p>However, once I had it, I started to realize how little perfect accuracy matters in my day-to-day life. It's nice, but not all that helpful. This train of thought led me to wonder about the old Elgin watch from my better-halfs' grandfather, and off I went.</p>
<p>This Seiko is typical, gaining 8-10 seconds per day. Every now and then I set it back a minute, and that seems to be good enough for me.</p>
<h2>Auto divers</h2>
<p>This Seiko is what's called an auto-diver, or automatic diver's watch. This is a <a href="http://www.equationoftime.com/forums/diveforum/">very</a> <a href="http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440">popular</a> <a href="http://www.makedostudio.com/watches/seiko-divers/">variety</a> of mechanical watch. An auto diver is an automatic (self-winding) watch designed for SCUBA or other divers. In the old days of diving, you had a depth gauge, wristwatch and some tables, designed to tell you how long you could stay on the bottom, time at each decompression stop, and so forth. Errors tended to be fatal, so the dive watches were optimized for durability, legibility and good timing. The one-way ratcheting bezel is an artifact of this; it ensures that the time will always be at least as much as indicated.</p>
<p>Of course, now computers do this much, much better. <a href="http://www.sportextreme.com/pq209/">Dive computers</a> do all the calculations, measure the depth, calculate times and generally rock. Really careful persons who dive might have the old-school gear as backup, but in general an auto-diver is a tribute to a need that no longer exists.</p>
<p>Who cares, though. The attributes prized by divers (extremely readable face, durability, strong nighttime luminosity) also make for a supremely functional watch. The obsolescence of the auto-diver is a nice complement to the obsolescence of the mechanical watch in general.</p>

          			<h3><a href = "http://fnord.phfactor.net/2005/06/13/Gigabit-ethernet-what-you-need.html">Gigabit ethernet - what you need</a></h3>
         			<span class="by">Posted on 13 Jun 2005.</span>
        			<p><p>For several years, those of us with home networks have been running 10/100 mixed LANs, usually with switches here and there. Works well, cheap, reliable and easy to wire. Very few indeed have home gigabit; the adapters are cheap but switches have been very expensive.However, that's no longer the case.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Cheap, reliable, low-power, no cooling fans. Oh yeah, I want fast, too, so we need jumbo frames (9000 byte packets instead of 1500; makes a huge difference in performance) and a fully non-blocking switch.</p>
<p>This is all on twisted pair, indoors, for home use.</p>
<p>For my network, I need an 8 port switch; you may be able to get by with less.</p>
<h2>Cut to the chase!</h2>
<p>If you need 8 ports, the best option I've found is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AKA95/qid=1108072034/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl23/102-3980408-2513710?v=glance&amp;s=electronics&amp;n=507846">SMC 8508T (Amazon, non-affiliate link)</a>. $100, jumbo frames, 15W power, no cooling fans, 16Gbit bisection bandwidth, decent blinky lights:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.phfactor.net/smc8508t.jpg" alt="Product image" /></p>
<p>If you can live with fewer ports, the otherwise-identical 5-port version is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AKA94/qid%3D1108072400/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/102-3980408-2513710">SMC 8505T (Amazon again)</a> for $67:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.phfactor.net/smc8505t.jpg" alt="Product image" /></p>
<p>About the only disadvantage of either one is that they use a wall-wart power supply instead of an internal. On the plus side, the do come with both rubber feet and rack ears. These are both really nice little switches in my opinion.</p>
<h2>Which network card should I buy?</h2>
<p>For network cards, I like the <a href="http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=250045">3Com 996BT (ZipZoomFly)</a>, about $60 from various venders. The <a href="http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=251402">Intel Pro 1000/XT</a> (130, ZZF) is also supposed good and reasonably cheap. If you've got the cash, the best card is the <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=syskonnect+9821&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle">SysKonnect SK9821 (Froogle, appx $100)</a>. To get good throughput, PCI-X or 66/64 is pretty much required. Otherwise, you'll get 2-3X faster than fast Ethernet at best.</p>
<p>Given that the SysKonnect prices have fallen fast (they used to cost $500) I'd recommend the 9821. I ended up with 3C996's, since I bought them a while ago when SysKonnext cost 6X more. Note that the 996 is actually a Broadcom chip, and uses the Tigon 3 driver (tg3) in Linux.</p>
<p>Many motherboards now have gigabit included on them as well. Bonus, that.</p>
<h2>Read For Yourself</h2>
<p>This page represents quite a bit of research for me, and I've just presented my conclusions. However, you don't have to take my word for it!</p>
<p>Anthony Betz and Paul Gray at Iowa did an <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/%7Egray/gig-over-copper/gig-over-copper.html">excellent review of gigabit/copper cards</a> that is where my recommendations come from. Read and be enlightened.</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li><p>For more about jumbo frames, read <a href="http://www.small-tree.com/jumbo1.htm">this commercial page</a> and <a href="http://sd.wareonearth.com/%7Ephil/jumbo.html">this WAN-based page</a>. I'm not sure I buy the huge improvements they graph, but you'll get the idea.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to know if a piece of hardware supports jumbo frames, dig into the tech specs. If it doesn't say jumbo frames are supported, assume they are not! This <a href="http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/%7Ejoe/jumbo-clean-gear.html">page at Oregon has a nice list of hardware</a> with and without jumbo support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things To Watch Out For</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It's pretty much impossible to tell online if a switch has cooling fans or not. Since most of them use the 40mm size, they make lots of noise and fail quickly. Google, or check it out in person. I've gotten a lot pickier about noise of late, so this was a showstopper for me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not all jumbo frames are created equal. Vendors have been know to call 82 extra bytes a jumbo. You want 9000 or better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My Dell Optiplex GX280's came with an onboard Gig-E card, a Broadcom BCM95751. It uses the same driver as my 3C996, but can't do jumbo frames! I have the same machine under XP, and no jumbo there either. Hardware limitation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Despite having gigabit on their laptops years before anyone else, Apple Powerbooks do not support jumbo frames.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No, this will not speed up your DSL connection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the first speed test you try is scp/sftp, you'll be disappointed. However, PSC has a 7-line patch to scp that speeds it <em>way</em> up. Like 10X faster. <a href="http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/">Go and get it.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>So why bother?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>High geek value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is faster, after all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can beat down anyone who complains about lag at your next LAN party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly: The hardware is now down around the cost levels of slower 10/100 gear, so there's no reason to pay 10 bucks less on a switch when you can get gigabit.</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>Update 10/3/07: See <a href="http://www.phfactor.net/wp/2007/10/04/more-cool-networking-gear/">this updated post</a> for a revised switch/router too.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a Unix weenie, I've become quite enamored with <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2003/10/01/notes100103.DTL&amp;nl=fix">my Macintosh laptop.</a> To the point of advocating them to friends and co-workers. This page is an unstructured attempt to list software I've found, and a few tips and tricks to make your life easier.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and please leave comments for myself and others. I try to keep the page updated, and if you leave a comment I'll get an email so do chime in!</p>
<h2>PC emulators for x86 Macs (Macbook, Pro)</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/">Parallels Workstation ($80)</a> is presently the first out of the gate. Seems to deliver around 80% of native performance with the exception of OpenGL. Still not as polished as VMWare or VirtualPC, but damned fast and workable. 2 week evaluation licenses available for the asking. <a href="http://www.vmware.com/mac">VMWare Fusion</a> is also $80, and I prefer it to Parallels for superior USB support and the ability to use all of those free VMWare images available online. Handy, those.</p>
<p>A new entrant is the Sun-funded <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. You can't beat <strong>free</strong>! I use it as well; not as polished and a trifle slower, but pretty darn good for zero cost.</p>
<p>Any of the above work; I default to VMware for compatibility with the existing stock of downloadable premade machine images.</p>
<h2>Development tools</h2>
<h3>You have to install Xcode off of the install DVD. It's the 'Optional installs' folder.</h3>
<h3>For all OSX users</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink project</a> is a <strong>must-have</strong>. Its a complete port of the GNU suite + Debian's package management tools. From their page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We modify Unix software so that it compiles and runs on Mac OS X("port" it) and make it available for download as a coherent distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marvelous. This gets you two key tools - apt and fink. With fink, you install from source and compile, a la the BSD ports method. With apt, you install precompiled binaries, like Debian.</p>
<p>For CVS assistance, check out <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/4143">this page</a>, which has links to several good GUI CVS tools. There are Fink packages for Subversion as well. Git is best downloaded from <a href="http://git-scm.com/">here</a> as a binary installer; it installs into /usr/local/git for some reason.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="http://darwinports.com/">Darwin Ports</a>, which is the BSD porting system (Open, Free and NetBSD, I think). I've not used it, but many are fans.</p>
<h2>Web browsers</h2>
<p>The defaults as of 10.4 is <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple's Safari browser</a>, which is pretty decent. <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, which is mac-native but built around the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a> engine, is also good. You can, of course, go get Firefox itself, particularly if you want Greasemonkey script support.</p>
<p>There's also the <a href="http://hmdt-web.net/shiira/en">Shiira</a> project, which is based on the same WebKit engine as Safari, but has better cookie management and other tweaks. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>Another solid choice is the now-free <a href="http://opera.com/">Opera.</a> It does an excellent emulation of IE, and is sometimes the only thing that will load a page for me.</p>
<p>As of Safari V4, I use it as my default and Firefox when I need specific tools like <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=609">Elasticfox</a>.</p>
<p>Newest is <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, which is pretty darn cool.</p>
<h2>Ad and Flash blockers</h2>
<p>The best ad blockers in my opinion are the ones implemented as HTTP proxies, as that works with any browser. These days, I strongly recommend <a href="http://glimmerblocker.org/">GlimmerBlocker</a> (free, GPL, runs as a control panel.)</p>
<p>You also want <a href="http://clicktoflash.com/">ClickToFlash</a>. Yes, you do. Option-click to whitelist a site.</p>
<p>Now that Safari has plugins/extensions, I love the '<a href="http://extensions.apple.com/#entertainment">A cleaner YouTube</a>' plugin; strips all the crap off of youtube pages.</p>
<h2>Bookmarking</h2>
<p>Ever since the advent of <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, people have been changing how and where they manage bookmarks. Local, del.icio.us, .mac, etc.</p>
<p>I encourage you to experiment. Try <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/12/14/safarilicious/">Safarilicious</a> to upload bookmarks from Safari to del.icio.us, then <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/25/delibar-the-missing-link-of-social-bookmarking/">Delibar</a> to make them convenient on the menubar. I have to admit that the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">Firefox Delicious plugin</a>, which maps them to a normal menu, is seven kinds of awesome.</p>
<h2>Mail, ftp, sftp, scp, rss</h2>
<p>Outlook fans should look at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/entouragex/entouragex.aspx?pid=entouragex">Microsoft Entourage</a> - it's free.</p>
<p>Personally, I quite like the Mail application; it works well for me with IMAPS and ASMTP.</p>
<p>For FTP, try <a href="http://icu.unizh.ch/~dkocher/cyberduck/">Cyberduck</a>,which is GPL and also handles sftp.</p>
<p>For scp/sftp only, <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a> is marvelous and also free. This is my preferred program, and highly recommended. By the way, the name 'fugu', comes from an elaborate joke based on sushi and cryptography, that is: Fugu is the part of the blowfish you can lick.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's at least 3 nerd jokes buried in there.</p>
<p>If you have heavier-duty sftp/ftp duties, <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> is worth the 30 bucks. Nice queueing system, iMac support, dashboard widget, etc.</p>
<p>A recent entrant that won my money is <a href="http://www.expandrive.com/mac">ExpanDrive</a>, which uses the MacFUSE layer to provide transparent access to <em>any</em> filesystem over SSH and S3. I use it daily and paid for it out of pocket. There's a free trial, too.</p>
<p>For RSS, I used to use the now-free <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>. These days, since I have the <a href="http://fnord.phfactor.net/category/iphone/">iPhone</a>, I've switched over to <a href="http://google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, which has the advantage of being always-synced between desktop and phone. There's a brand new app called <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a> that self-hosts and looks interesting, but for now I'll stick with Google.</p>
<h2>IRC and instant messaging</h2>
<p>For IRC, the <a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a> client is most excellent. <a href="http://psi-im.org/">Psi</a> is excellent for XMPP/Jabber.</p>
<p>For instant messenger, <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a> is a good cross-system app, though it can't do audio or video chat. For that, the included <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/ichat.html">iChat</a> is good, as are <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a> and <a href="http://www.skype.com/welcomeback/">Skype</a>. <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/">FaceTime</a> is still beta but an interesting idea.</p>
<h2>Office Software</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/">Microsoft Office for Mac</a> works quite well; make sure and get the patches. There's a free (time bombed) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.aspx?pid=testdrive">test drive available</a>.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/ooo-osx_downloads.html">OpenOffice as well</a>, which is free and evolving rapidly.</p>
<p>These days I mostly use <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a> for when I need a DOC file or spreadsheet. For documentation and simple formatting, I actually prefer writing HTML files - they have a lot of advantages and for most documents their formatting suffices. Try <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/">Mozilla SeaMonkey</a> for a good free WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<p>For Visio-type functionality, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle Pro</a> is great. If you have a laptop, you may have a copy bundled with the machine in /Applications.</p>
<p>For presentation software, Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> is both megaspiffy and reads and writes Powerpoint. I like it. O'Reilly has <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/4185"> a flattering review of Keynote</a> as a total replacement for Powerpoint. Keynote is now part of <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">the iWork suite</a>.</p>
<p>For screen captures, which I use quite a bit for generating documentation, OSX includes a program called 'Grab' that does a decent job. It outputs TIFFs, but you can use Folder Actions to auto-convert to JPG/PNG. Or you can do what I've done, and pay the money for <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">Snapz Pro</a>. It has a bunch of additional capabilites, like capturing movies of the desktop, audio, etc. Free trial available.</p>
<h2>Scheduling, Entourage integration, iCal(endar)</h2>
<p>One common requirement when working with Windows machines is Outlook integration. This is partially possible with a bit of work. Outlook can export iCalendar-format .ics files, which are compatible with iCal and Mail. This is my solution right now, and seems to work OK.</p>
<p>If you're using iCal, check out <a href="http://www.objectpark.net/mcc.html">MenuCalendarClock.</a> It replaces the time in the upper right, but you can have it display a calendar and (if you pay) your iCal schedule for the day! Wonderful, unobtrusive, works great.</p>
<p>For calendar sharing, I've spent many hours on this to very poor results, so I have to recommend MobileMe or Google Calendars. If you have Exchange server, that works too. No great solutions here, at least not for free.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis, Graphing, Math</strong></p>
<p>For time-series data, I am a long-time fan of the cross-platform <a href="http://www.synergy.com/">Kaleidagraph</a>. Excellent plots and analysis tools.</p>
<p>If you need it, <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MATLAB</a> is available. Not cheap, but that's always been true.</p>
<p>The same applies to <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>, of course.</p>
<p>For freeware, <a href="http://www.octave.org/">Octave</a> is a GNU workalike for MATLAB; there are others depending on your needs. The <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Project</a> is another alternative is you need lots of statistics.</p>
<h2>Editors</h2>
<p>A perennial favorite is called <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a>- very nice support for code (compilation, code highlighting, CVS), HTML, etc. They also have a simpler, free version called <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml">TextWrangler.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml"> </a></p>
<p>I've paid for and like <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, it's quite code-friendly and expandable.</p>
<p>Emacs works in Terminal; if you</p>
<pre><code> setenv TERM dtterm
</code></pre>
<p>then syntax highlighting works as well.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a>, which looks even better. I use it and quite like it.</p>
<p>More recent editors also include <a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/">Smultron (GPL!)</a>, <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate (commercial)</a> and <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">JEdit (GPL, Java, cross-platform)</a></p>
<p>JEdit in particular seems to have quite the following, as of 2/06 there were over 80 plugins for it. Seems a bit easier to use than the full-bore-IDE of Eclipse.</p>
<p>For Python, IPython and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo/">Komodo</a> make a good combo, as does TextMate for simpler code.</p>
<h3>TeX and LaTeX</h3>
<p>Once you've got Fink installed, you can install TeX and LaTex. A nice GUI shell for working with them is <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/%7Ekoch/texshop">TeXShop</a>, which works a treat. Note that, for strange reasons, it uses pdftex, which is not quite the same as vanilla TeX as far as, say, EPS support.</p>
<h2>Menu bar applets</h2>
<p>These live on the menu bar, always running and doing useful stuff.</p>
<p>Start off by getting <a href="http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatmenus/">iStat Menus</a>. It shows CPU, network, disk activity and more. Free, polished, donation-ware. (Version 2 is nag-ware, so I'm no longer using it.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/">MenuMeters</a> is a GPL'd program to monitor memory, disk activity, network, swap and such. Also gives fast access to things like the Activity Monitor, network settings, net util, etc. Almost as good as iStat.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/">SSH Keychain</a> is another GPL'd utility that I <strong>highly</strong> recommend. It handles your SSH key for you, can optionally revoke it on sleep/screensaver, integrates with Fugu, SSH tunnel manager, ssh, scp, sftp, CVS, etc. Wonderful stuff.</p>
<p>See above under 'Scheduling' for MenubarCalendarClock - recommended.</p>
<p><a href="http://heat-meteo.sourceforge.net/">Meteo</a> is a free, open-source applet that displays weather on the menubar. Simple, flexible, reliable. Quite nice, especially if you have a windowless office, or travel a lot.</p>
<p>One of the annoying things about the mac clipboard is that it only stores one entry. When I'm writing something up, its often useful to have several URLs available. Until now, I had experimented with the commercial <a href="http://www.iggsoftware.com/ipaste/index.html">iPaste</a>, but didn't like it enough to keep past the trial.</p>
<p>I just found a free replacement called <a href="http://www.snarkout.org/projects/jumpcut/">Jumpcut</a> that is a must-download. It puts a small icon on the menubar, with a dropdown list of entries. Clicking moves that entry into the clipboard for use. That way, I can keep the last 20 or so things I copied or cut around... really handy. Another way to get this functionality is to run <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/">LaunchBar</a>, which has it as a side feature.</p>
<h2>Cool Random Stuff</h2>
<p>When I had a Linux desktop at work, I used to have xplanet running as a backdrop, with hand-scripted alpha-blended cloud data from the UWisc Near-IR satellite. I was the nerd equivalent of a hipster. Now, of course, you can get the same effect, only more so and free, on OSX. Head on over to <a href="http://otte.ucsc.edu/~gabriel/osxplanet.html">this page and get OSXPlanet</a>, which is one of the coolest programs you'll see in a long time. Free, too.</p>
<p>Prepare to waste many hours if you've not tried <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>. Be sure to try the flight simulator part!</p>
<p>There's an awesome Mac-only app called <a href="http://streamripperx.sourceforge.net/">StreamRipperX</a> that takes an Internet radio station and writes MP3 files to disk from the content. Set it running, leave it overnight, and come back in the
morning to a bunch of nicely named and saved files. Mondo cool.</p>
<p>For wireless networks, <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/kismac/?topic_id=861%2C43%2C152">KisMAC</a> does a great job and has the side benefit of not sending anything, ensuing that innocent searching does not bring down the wrath of the network BOFH.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/">ProFont</a> is a monospaced font for Mac, Windows and Unix designed for code. Wonderful stuff. It has a lot of little touches, such as distinguishable l/1, slashed zeros, clear punctuation, and others. Also excellent for terminal windows. There's also <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html">AnonymousPro</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Quicksilver</strong></p>
<p>One hard-to-classify app is a piece of freeware called <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver.</a> It's sort of a search program, that can do many other things. Launch programs, search your bookmarks, file management, all sorts of stuff. I used to be a hardcore fan, but the developer abandoned it and it's gotten less reliable as the OS evolved. These days I run <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/">LaunchBar</a> instead; ahh well. Very similar in function and definitely more polished than QS was.</p>
<p>Battery and sleep - OSX is a bit annoying about sleep and hibernate, but <a href="http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html">SmartSleep</a> will solve the problem for you. Recommended.</p>
<p>Screensavers and eye candy</p>
<p>If you've got 3D onboard, the <a href="http://www.ati.com/developer/demos/macss2/index.html">ATI OpenGL demos and screensavers</a> are awesome. And free.</p>
<p>The essential Matrix screensaver is called <a href="http://meta.ath0.com/articles/2005/05/10/redpill-1-4-2">Red Pill</a>. Free, very well done, open source.</p>
<h2>PGP/GPG, Mail plugins and utilities</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.tikouka.net/mailapp/">This page has plugins for Mail</a>, including stuff like Entourage imports, spamcop, mail count in the menubar,all sorts of amazing and useful stuff.</p>
<p>For GPG, I use the <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">MacGPG</a> distribution plus the <a href="http://www.sente.ch/software/GPGMail/English.lproj/GPGMail.html">GPGMail plugin.</a> Works fabulously, though you need to set the 'By default, use OpenPGP/MIME' option for some clients to recognize and parse the emails. (Mutt + gpg, in particular.)</p>
<p>For figuring out where your disk space went, try the visual <a href="http://www.derlien.com/">Disk Inventory X</a>. Works great.</p>
<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>Of course, as of 10.5 <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a> is the hot ticket. Buy an external drive or <a href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/">TimeCapsule</a> and be done with it. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Another alternative is the free-but-must-register <a href="http://www.silverkeeper.com/">Silverkeeper</a> from LaCie. Scheduled backups, free, GUI, OS9 and OSX support, looks pretty good, works well.</p>
<p>Many people swear by <a href="http://www.dantz.com/en/products/index.dtml">Dantz Retrospect</a>; I've not tried it.</p>
<p>Apple also has a <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/backup.html">free graphical backup program</a> that can write to firewire, CD/DVD, iDisk, and also has scheduling capability. However, if you don't have a .Mac membership, it's crippled to only writing to .Mac. Which kind of sucks.</p>
<p>If you have the Serious Mojo, you can <a href="http://www.tnpi.biz/computing/mac/tips/idisk/idisk-v2.shtml">create your own dot-mac replacement</a> and use Apple Backup with it. I've not yet tried this, but its a nice hack.</p>
<p>For partial backups and true bidirectional sync, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a> is pretty amazing. Cross-platform, free, fast, and hard as hell to configure. I spent the time, based on the recommendation of <a href="http://cr.yp.to/">a friend of mine</a>, and it's excellent. I sync my desktop, bookmarks, calendars, addressbook and some reference data folders twice a day with my desktop, and its enabled me to leave the laptop at home. Well worth the effort.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Sooner or later you'll want to replace/upgrade a hard drive, battery or such. Head to <a href="http://ifixit.com/">iFixit</a> for a comprehensive set of visual do-it-yourself tutorials.</p>
<p>Books</p>
<p>O'Reilly has <a href="http://mac.oreilly.com/">many excellent books </a>you'll want; I am particularly fond of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mosxgeeks/">Mac OS X for Unix Geeks.</a> <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/macosxmm/">Mac OSX: The Missing Manual</a> is an excellent overall intro, with pointers to in-depth resources. A good place to start.</p>
<h2>Carrying cases</h2>
<p>I've hesitated to add this section, as bags tend to be a religous topic for people. On the other hand, I'd like to advocate what I like.</p>
<p>I've had several bags over the past few years, starting with a basic attache-style laptop bag from Lands' End. It worked fine for my Thinkpad, but is a little too small to carry the 15" powerbook. Also, the padding is minimal. Other than that, a decent bag, nicely unobtrusive.</p>
<p>Next I went to a <a href="http://www.targus.com/us/product_details.asp?sku=TSB315">Targus sport deluxe backpack.</a> It works pretty well for carrying lots of stuff, and excels at heavy loads. Things that annoyed me enough to switch:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Dangling straps. Lots of them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Main fastener broke in short order, so the flap was held only by gravity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Main pack is split in two, so you can't carry large items.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A bit large. Doesn't travel well, especially under airline seats.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, I got a nice leather briefcase in Brazil. Super-classy, good fit, decent padding. However, it just doesn't hold enough to be useful; I save it for occasions when I need to look good.</p>
<h3>Timbuktu!</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/obssob.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I then bought a <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/catalog/categories.t2?categoryId=7">Timbuk2 Commute bag</a> at the Apple store downtown. I actually saw it one day, went home and researched it, and went back the next day to buy it. It rocks. It's by far the nicest and best-made bag I've ever had. Just enough volume, lots of pockets and niches, most excellent padding, waterproof to boot, and super comfortable. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Update August 2006: According to the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/macbookpro.ars/2">Ars Technica review</a>, the MBP 15" won't <em>quite</em> fit in the Commute bag. Damn.</p>
<p>Update Dec 2006: The Macbookpro fits quite well in the Timbuktu. I've now traveled twice with it, no problem, recommended.</p>
<p>Update Dec 2006:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001494.php">![](http://www.phfactor.net/wp-pics/bbp1sm.jpg)</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001494.php">Bum Backpack Messenger bag</a> gets a strong recommend from Cool Tools. Haven't tried it personally, but looks good.</p>
<h3>...and back to REI again</h3>
<p>As of October 2004, my commute has changed - I now have a 30-minute walk to the bus stop, and the reverse coming home. Also, I'm now using <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a> to sync the powerbook with the desktop, so I don't need to pack the powerbook along. In this situation, the Timbuktu doesn't work very well, and I've gotten a nice <a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&amp;catalogId=40000008000&amp;productId=47928395&amp;parent_category_rn=4501697">REI backpack</a>. No computer sleeve, but good for carrying everything else. Might try it on my next trip to SD West.</p>
<p>Update Aug 2006: The REI bag continues to work pretty well for the daily walking commute, but its a bit suboptimal for airlines. The Timbuktu is still preferred for that.</p>
<p>For a complete list of bags that will fit the powerbooks, please see <a href="http://forums.macnn.com/showthread.php?t=178702">this page on MacNN.</a> This list has 'em all!</p>
<h3>... and back to Timbuktu Yet Again!</h3>
<p>Wow, soap opera, eh? What can I say, I'm picky. Current choice for the past year or so is<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Timbuk2-Track-Laptop-Backpack-strap/dp/B000JZ4VZG/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;s=apparel&amp;qid=1211321686&amp;sr=1-10"> this Timbuktu backpack</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ttrack.jpg">![](http://fnord.phfactor.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ttrack.jpg)</a>It's better for the long walks I have to and from the bus now, and has been excellent. Doesn't hold a lot, but that's just fine.</p>
<h2>External keyboards and mice</h2>
<p>I love the <a href="http://www.dansdata.com/clickykeyboards.htm">old-school IBM keyboards</a>, despite the noise. You can now get the same thing for Mac with the <a href="http://matias.ca/tactilepro/index.php">Matias TactilePro.</a> I've had one for several months and love it. Noisy, but who cares?</p>
<p>For mice, get whatever multibutton type suits. I like Logitech and MS more or less equally. At least two buttons, and scroll wheel is nice too.</p>
<h2>Other Notes for Unix people</h2>
<p>A neat trick at the command line - use the</p>
<pre><code>open
</code></pre>
<p>command to simulate a double-click in the Finder. So you can 'open .' to get a new finder window of the current directory, or 'open *.doc' and so forth. Very useful.</p>
<p>Use</p>
<pre><code> alias ssh ssh -AXY
</code></pre>
<p>That forwards agent connections and X11, and fixes a broken-ness with X and SSH that otherwise shows up in programs like xdvi.</p>
<h3><strong>Other References</strong></h3>
